# generative-ai-research-analysis
Text mining and bibliometric analysis of Generative AI research trends using datasets from OpenAlex and ArXiv. Includes preprocessing, TF-IDF, keyword centrality, and LDA topic modeling.
---

## Objectives
Which domains or sub-domains are experiencing rapid growth in Generative AI?
How are research topics evolving over time (2019–2024)?
What are the most frequent or emerging keywords, concepts, or models?
Are there identifiable thematic clusters or research communities?
Who is driving this research? Which countries, institutions, or authors are dominant?
Can emerging or declining topics be detected?
